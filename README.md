# Open Source at Open Raven
This is the main README for open source projects at [Open Raven](https://www.openraven.com). The majority of the engineering here is done by our Research team, a full-time research and development team that focuses on cloud and data security. 

We run an active Slack Workspace that is open to everyone to discuss, ask questions or share ideas. You can join our Slack [here](https://join.slack.com/t/open-raven-research/shared_invite/zt-np27xiev-N5rL4AcTmrQt8YkE81BIaw)

We encourage and welcome [community contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md). 

You operate with a [community code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Flagship Project - Magpie
Our flagship project is Magpie, a cloud security analysis tool that is going beyond traditional CSPM into mapping extended surfaces areas like Kuberbernetes and using complex rules beyond compliance checks. You can find the Magpie repo [here](https://github.com/openraven/magpie)

## Security 
You can read our security polciy [here](SECURITY.md)

## Licenses and Code Contributions

We release all open source code under an [Apache 2.0 license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/) unless the individual tool repo states otherwise. Any code contributions that are accepted are bound by the license.
